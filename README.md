## Free Subdomains under foo.ng

This project offers free subdomains under the `foo.ng` domain for anyone who needs a custom URL for their web project, Minecraft server, or anything else that can be pointed to via a DNS record.

### What is "foo"?

The term "foo" is a placeholder word often used in computer programming and technical examples. It doesn't have a specific meaning, but it's used to represent a generic name or concept when the actual name doesn't matter.

**Important Note:** You can only configure one record type per subdomain: either an [A Record](https://foo.ng/a) (points directly to an IP address) or a [CNAME Record](https://foo.ng/cname) (points to another domain name).

        - Replace `your-target-location` with your project's location depending on the record type:
            - For an A Record: Use the IP address your project is hosted on (e.g., "127.0.0.1"). 
            - For a CNAME Record: Use the domain name your project is currently accessible on (e.g., "cname.example.com").
